# JavaScript Array methods

It's as simple, as it looks, given the array of objects, count how many people have voted, return the count.
Should be 7 people.

```javascipt
const voters = [
    {name:'Bob' , age: 30, voted: true},
    {name:'Jake' , age: 32, voted: true},
    {name:'Kate' , age: 25, voted: false},
    {name:'Sam' , age: 20, voted: false},
    {name:'Phil' , age: 21, voted: true},
    {name:'Ed' , age:55, voted:true},
    {name:'Tami' , age: 54, voted:true},
    {name: 'Mary', age: 31, voted: false},
    {name: 'Becky', age: 43, voted: false},
    {name: 'Joey', age: 41, voted: true},
    {name: 'Jeff', age: 30, voted: true},
    {name: 'Zack', age: 19, voted: false}
];
```

The same array, now let us practice the _sort_ method, sort the voters by age, from youngest to oldest.

```javascipt
const voters = [
    {name:'Bob' , age: 30, voted: true},
    {name:'Jake' , age: 32, voted: true},
    {name:'Kate' , age: 25, voted: false},
    {name:'Sam' , age: 20, voted: false},
    {name:'Phil' , age: 21, voted: true},
    {name:'Ed' , age:55, voted:true},
    {name:'Tami' , age: 54, voted:true},
    {name: 'Mary', age: 31, voted: false},
    {name: 'Becky', age: 43, voted: false},
    {name: 'Joey', age: 41, voted: true},
    {name: 'Jeff', age: 30, voted: true},
    {name: 'Zack', age: 19, voted: false}
];
```

Here is a wishlist, count the total price for all items in the wishlist.

```javascript
const wishlist = [
  { title: "Tesla Model S", price: 90000 },
  { title: "4 carat diamond ring", price: 45000 },
  { title: "Fancy hacky Sack", price: 5 },
  { title: "Gold fidgit spinner", price: 2000 },
  { title: "A second Tesla Model S", price: 90000 },
];
// 227005
```
